          <p>
            I am a web developer based in London. Prior to undertaking the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course I completed a degree in management and IT and have worked in a number of companies understanding the importance of technology in business. </p>

            <p>Feeling restricted due to my lack of technical skill I decided to pursue a career in web development. </p>
